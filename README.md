# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills and projects in a unique book/magazine-style format. The project is built with React using Vite, and uses the `react-pageflip` library to create a flipbook-like user experience.

## Features

- **Hamburger menu**: Switch between different sections easily.
- **Dynamic background**: Background images can change depending on the section of the portfolio.

## Technologies Used
